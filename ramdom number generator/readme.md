This is a simple number generator 
random.randint(0,999)
if you want to gen a number between 0 and 100, change "999" to "100"[random.randint(0,change this)] and the program will generate a number between 0 and 100
[]: # Language: python
if you don't want [Run again? (y/n) ] delete That 
like this:
'import random
number = random.randint(0,999)
print(number)'
